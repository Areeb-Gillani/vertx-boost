# vertx-boost
This project adds the flavor of SpringBoot's style annotations in vertx to reduce the learning curve. It follows the same annotation style such as @RestController, @Service, @Autowired, @RequestParam, @RequestBody, @PostMapping &amp; @GetMapping whereas controller and service classes should extend AbstractVerticle as per the requirement of Vertx.
